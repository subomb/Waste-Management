# Simplified Intelligent Waste Management System

## Project Summary
The Simplified Intelligent Waste Management System is designed to improve the efficiency of waste management in suburban and rural areas. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), it automates the monitoring of waste bin fill levels, providing real-time notifications and enhancing the waste collection process.

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the inefficiencies of manual waste management by providing a real-time monitoring system. It is particularly suited for smaller communities, schools, or individual households that are not the focus of high-end, industrial-scale IoT solutions.

## Features
- Continuous monitoring of waste levels using ultrasonic sensors
- Real-time fill level displayed in the terminal
- Notifications for near-full bins to prompt timely waste collection

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply for Raspberry Pi

## Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS or any compatible Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3.x
- GPIO library (if not pre-installed)

## Hardware Setup
1. **Sensor Mounting**: Attach the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the underside of the bin's lid, ensuring it faces downward.
2. **Wiring**: Connect the sensor to the Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins. Use GPIO 18 for TRIG and GPIO 16 for ECHO.
3. **Power**: Power up the Raspberry Pi and ensure it is connected to a display or accessible via SSH.

## Software Setup
Clone the repository and ensure that all required software is installed on the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage
Navigate to the script directory and execute the script using the following command:

python3 waste_management.py

The terminal will display the bin's fill level, updated periodically.

To stop the script, press Ctrl + C in the terminal, which will trigger the GPIO cleanup routine.

## Source Code Structure
waste_management.py: Main script that interfaces with the ultrasonic sensor and calculates the bin's fill level. 
It includes:
Imports and GPIO Setup: Set up the GPIO pins for communication with the sensor.

measure_distance Function: Triggers the sensor and reads the distance measurement.

Main Loop: Continuously checks the bin's fill level and prints updates to the terminal.

Cleanup: Ensures GPIO pins are cleaned up properly on script termination.

## Future Improvements
The current version of the Simplified Intelligent Waste Management System serves its purpose effectively, but we envision several enhancements to improve user experience and system capabilities:
1. **Local Interface on Trashcan**: Incorporating a small screen, like an LCD or OLED display, attached directly to the trashcan to show the fill level in real-time. This local interface would allow users to see the status without accessing the terminal.
2. **Sustainability Upgrade**: Exploring the integration of solar panels to power the system, reducing environmental impact and operational costs.
3. **Scalability for Multiple Bins**: Expanding the system's capabilities to monitor multiple bins, which could be essential for larger facilities or public spaces.
     Implement a centralized monitoring dashboard that shows the status of all bins, which could help in planning efficient waste collection routes and schedules.
